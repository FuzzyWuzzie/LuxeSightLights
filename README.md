# LuxeSightLights

[Luxe](http://luxeengine.com/) implementation of [Sight & Light](http://ncase.me/sight-and-light/) by the wonderfully talented [Nicky Case](http://ncase.me/).

>PLEASE NOTE! This demo was created using an ALPHA version of [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com/). As such, it may very well be obsolete by the time you look at it. It is current and working as of `alpha-2.0`, however the API can and likely will change without any hesitation! You've been warned!
